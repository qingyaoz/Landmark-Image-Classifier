# Landmark-Image-Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to develop a classifier using supervised deep learning techniques for image data to distinguishe images of two famous landmark: the Pantheon and the Hofburg Imperial Palace.

## Techniques
- 
- Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification.
- Explore supervised pretraining, a type of transfer learning method, to augment classification abilities..
- Experiment with data augmentation to enrich training data and improve the robustness of models. 
- Implement and train a deep neural network to classify images of two landmarks.
